## What is this?

This is a **motherfucking website** with a **motherfucking stylesheet**. And it's **fucking perfect**.

It's a fork of the legendary [motherfuckingwebsite.com](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but with just enough **style** to make your eyes weep with joy.

## Why This Exists

Minimal CSS should be beautiful **and practical**. This stylesheet makes your site look great **without** turning your HTML into a graveyard of class names.

## How?

I took **motherfuckingwebsite.com**, slapped a stylesheet on it, and called it a **day**.

## Want to use this?

Go right the fuck ahead. No permissions, no bullshitâ€”just **CSS, baby**.

### How to Use

Drop `base.css` in your project like it's hot.

Or don't. I'm not your dad.

If you want to live dangerously, copy-paste the styles directly into your `<head>`, because importing stylesheets is for cowards.

## For real

The past several years I've been swirling and intermingling the concepts of atomic and classless CSS. I love elements of both. With classless CSS you can achieve a remarkable aesthetic using only semantic HTML. Love this. Atomic CSS creates a wonderful uniformity by imposing a design system and consistency by means of convention.

Both approaches aren't without their limitations either. Classless can truly only take you so far, before bespoke CSS is necessary. At which point you're now left to conjure up the same sorts of concepts you would on every project: spacing, color paletee, font sizes etc. Atomic CSS on the other hand can lead to crazy, obscure class definitions that begin losing all meaning (i.e., buttons are a great example of this).

This project is an attempt to have a (satirical) conversation about marrying the two. A classless CSS reset that gets out of your way. With a design system, by way of CSS variables, that can be applied to any project (not unlike an atomic CSS library). And perhaps most importantly can be easily customized by augmenting the CSS variables in your own stylesheet.

I knew I wanted:
- a CSS reset
- defined spacing
- defined font sizes
- defined color palette
- a beautiful base font pairing

I have really enjoyed the process of creating this project. I hope you enjoy it too.
