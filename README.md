## What is this?

This is a **motherfucking stylesheet** for a **motherfucking website**. And it's **fucking perfect**.

It's a fork of the legendary [motherfuckingwebsite.com](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but with just enough **style** to make your eyes weep with joy.

## How?

I took **motherfuckingwebsite.com**, slapped a stylesheet on it, and called it a **day**.

## Why?

Because being cheesy isn't easy. But looking good? That should be.

## Want to use this?

Go right the fuck ahead. No permissions, no bullshitâ€”just **CSS, baby**.
