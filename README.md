## What is this?

This is a **motherfucking website** with a **motherfucking stylesheet**. And it's **fucking perfect**.

It's a fork of the legendary [motherfuckingwebsite.com](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but with just enough **style** to make your eyes weep with joy.

## Why This Exists

Minimal CSS should be beautiful **and practical**. This stylesheet makes your site look great **without** turning your HTML into a graveyard of class names.

## How?

I took **motherfuckingwebsite.com**, slapped a stylesheet on it, and called it a **day**.

## Want to use this?

Go right the fuck ahead. No permissions, no bullshitâ€”just **CSS, baby**.

### How to Use

Drop `base.css` in your project like it's hot.

Or don't. I'm not your dad.

If you want to live dangerously, copy-paste the styles directly into your `<head>`, because importing stylesheets is for cowards.
