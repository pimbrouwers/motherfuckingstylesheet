        <h1>This is a motherfucking website with a stylesheet.</h1>
        <p><i>And it's fucking perfect.</i></p>

        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>

        <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home
            page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think
            your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong,
            motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast.</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens.</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers.</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site.</li>
            <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters
                drinking coffee).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to
            animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it
            and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat
            sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they
            don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>

        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h6 id="lightweight">It's fucking lightweight</h6>

                <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site.
                    Did you
                    seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div?
                    You
                    loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the
                    beginning of
                    your site? You piece of shit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h6 id="responsive">It's responsive</h6>

                <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it
                    responds
                    to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or
                    a
                    motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h6 id="works">It fucking works</h6>

                <p>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has
                    motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the
                    fuck's in
                    this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>

                <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account,
                    but you
                    spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery
                    ScrollTo
                    plugin is.</p>

                <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking
            idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be
            text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>

        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we
            have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they
            are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>

        <h2>Root Variables: The Carrots of Your CSS Diet</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Instead of littering your HTML with a hundred utility classes like a chaotic gremlin:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;button class="p-4 text-xl font-bold bg-black hover:bg-gray-800 active:bg-gray-700 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-indigo-500 disabled:opacity-50"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Seriously, what is this? A **button**, or a secret code to launch a spaceship?</p>

            <p>Instead, use **variables** like a civilized human:</p>

            <pre><code>button {
  padding: var(--s3);
  font-size: var(--f4); font-weight: 700;
  background: black;
  color: white }

button:hover {
  background: gray;
  color: black }

button:focus {
  outline: 1px solid purple; }

button:disabled {
    opacity: .5 } </code></pre>

            <p>Look at that. **Readable. Maintainable. Elegant.**</p>

            <p>No **class soup**, no searching through a 500-page Tailwind config file, no existential crisis over
                whether
                <code>pl-4</code> or <code>px-4</code> is the right choice. Just **pure, uncut CSS**, like nature
                intended.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2 id="install">Install</h2>
        <section>
            <p>You want to make a beautiful website? Good. But you don't want to spend hours tweaking pixels like a
                fool?
                Even better. Just include <code>base.css</code> like this:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css"&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>Want to find base.css? Open DevTools (F12 like a pro), go to the Network tab, reload the page, and look
                for a
                file named base.css. go to the Network tab, reload the page, and look for something called base.css. If
                that
                sounds too complicated, just right-click anywhere, hit Inspect, and start clicking around like a
                caffeinated
                raccoon digging through a trash can. You'll find it. I believe in you.</p>

            <p><strong>Boom.</strong> That's it. Your site is now <em>stunning</em>. No 20MB framework, no 500-class
                utility
                system, no CSS-in-JS nonsense. Just <strong>one damn file</strong> that makes everything look good.</p>

            <p>I know what you're thinking,</p>

            <blockquote>"But duuuuude what if I don't want an extra request?"</blockquote>

            <p>Fine. You want <strong>real efficiency</strong>? Paste the whole stylesheet right inside your HTML like a
                savage:</p>

            <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
    /* Behold, the only stylesheet you will ever need */
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>That's right. No build steps. No dependencies. No BS. Just <strong>pure, uncut, artisanal CSS</strong>.
            </p>
